- ✅ Configuration loader (`ConfigurationLoader`) implemented
- ✅ Test data generator implemented
- ✅ Test reporting manager implemented
- ✅ Test metrics manager implemented
- ✅ Azure DevOps test reporter implemented
- ✅ Element interaction base implemented
- ✅ Test context logger implemented
- ✅ Trace manager implemented

## Sample Tests

- ✅ Sample end-to-end test implemented (intentionally failing for verification)
- ✅ Search functionality test implemented (intentionally failing for verification)
- ✅ API documentation navigation test implemented (passing)
- ✅ Navigation and title verification test implemented (passing)

## Recent Changes

1. Fixed namespace references in multiple files:

   - Updated from `ParkPlaceSample.Config` to `ParkPlaceSample.Infrastructure.Config`
   - Ensured proper configuration initialization
   - Added logging for configuration loading

2. Test Infrastructure Verification:

   - Added intentionally failing tests to verify error reporting
   - Confirmed test parallelization is working
   - Verified trace and video capture for failed tests
   - Validated logging and reporting functionality

3. Code Cleanup:
   - Removed redundant `Test1.cs` file
   - Consolidated test examples in `SampleTest.cs`
   - Added global using directives in project file

## Current Test Results

- Total Tests: 4
- Passed: 2
- Failed: 2 (intentional failures for verification)
- Skipped: 0

## Known Issues

1. Warning CS8604: Possible null reference arguments in various locations
2. Warning CS1998: Async method lacks 'await' operators in ElementInteractionBase
3. Warning CS8618: Non-nullable field must contain non-null value in AzureDevOpsTestReporter

## Next Steps

1. Address nullable reference warnings
2. Implement proper async/await in ElementInteractionBase
3. Add more comprehensive test cases
4. Implement API testing infrastructure
5. Add data-driven test examples
