# Project Status

## Infrastructure Setup

✅ MSTest and Playwright integration
✅ Configuration management with environment support
✅ Logging infrastructure with structured logging
✅ Test reporting with ExtentReports
✅ Video recording and trace capture
✅ Screenshot capture on test failure
✅ Test parallelization enabled

## Framework Components

### Base Classes

- ✅ TestBase with proper initialization and cleanup
- ✅ Resource management for Playwright objects
- ✅ Exception handling and logging

### Configuration

- ✅ Strongly-typed settings classes
- ✅ Environment-specific configuration
- ✅ Configuration validation

### Reporting

- ✅ HTML report generation with modern styling
- ✅ Test artifacts organization (videos, traces, logs)
- ✅ Proper file handling and encoding
- ✅ Download options for all artifacts

### Logging

- ✅ Structured logging with log levels
- ✅ Test context logging
- ✅ HTML formatting for logs
- ✅ Log file generation and attachment

### Tracing

- ✅ Playwright trace recording
- ✅ Trace viewer integration
- ✅ Proper trace file management

## Sample Tests

### End-to-End Tests

- ✅ Basic navigation and interaction
- ✅ Search functionality
- ✅ API documentation tests
- ✅ Navigation and title verification

### Infrastructure Verification

- ✅ Intentionally failing tests
- ✅ Error reporting verification
- ✅ Artifact generation verification

## Recent Changes

1. HTML Report Improvements:

   - Added modern, responsive design
   - Improved artifact organization
   - Enhanced error reporting
   - Added download options for all artifacts

2. Test Artifacts:

   - Proper video recording handling
   - Enhanced trace file management
   - Improved log file formatting
   - Better file organization

3. Configuration:

   - Fixed base URL handling
   - Improved environment settings
   - Enhanced configuration validation

4. Resource Management:
   - Improved cleanup procedures
   - Better file handling
   - Enhanced error handling

## Current Test Results

- Total Tests: 4
- Passed: 2 (APIDocsNavigationTest, NavigationAndTitleVerificationTest)
- Failed: 2 (Intentional failures for verification)
  - SampleEndToEndTest: Verifies error reporting
  - SearchFunctionalityTest: Verifies results validation

## Known Issues

1. Nullable reference warnings:

   - TestContext.TestName usage
   - Configuration property access
   - Method parameter validation

2. Async method warnings:
   - ElementInteractionBase async method implementation

## Next Steps

1. Address nullable reference warnings
2. Enhance error handling in edge cases
3. Add more comprehensive test cases
4. Improve test categorization
5. Enhance logging for better debugging
6. Add performance metrics tracking
7. Implement retry logic for flaky tests
8. Add more documentation

## Notes

- Test infrastructure is functioning correctly
- HTML reports are properly formatted
- Test artifacts are being generated and attached
- Configuration system is working as expected
- Logging system provides good visibility
- Resource cleanup is working properly
